UCLA CS118 2022 Fall Quarter Project 2 (Simple Router)
====================================

The developers are supposed to test and run their code in a virtual environment that has all dependencies installed like a container or a virtual machine .
We have included a [`Vagrantfile`](Vagrantfile) and a [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) for the developers to build the virtual development environment,

## Makefile

The provided `Makefile` provides several targets, including to build `router` implementation.  The starter code includes only the framework to receive raw Ethernet frames and to send Ethernet frames to the desired interfaces.  Your job is to implement the routers logic.

Additionally, the `Makefile` a `clean` target, and `tarball` target to create the submission file as well.

You will need to modify the `Makefile` to add your userid for the `.tar.gz` turn-in at the top of the file.

## Academic Integrity Note

You are encouraged to host your code in private repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or other places.  At the same time, you are PROHIBITED to make your code for the class project public during the class or any time after the class.  If you do so, you will be violating academic honestly policy that you have signed, as well as the student code of conduct and be subject to serious sanctions.

## Known Limitations

When POX controller is restrated, the simpler router needs to be manually stopped and started again.
